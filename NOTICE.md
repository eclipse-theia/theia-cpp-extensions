## Electron

NOTICE:

Please note Electron combines Chromium and Node.js into a single runtime.
While Electron, Chromium and Node.js are generally licensed under very
permissive MIT and BSD-3-Clause licenses, both Electron and Chromium distribute
FFmpeg.  While FFmpeg is under the LGPL-2.1-or-later license it incorporates
several optional parts and optimizations that are covered by the
GPL-2.0-or-later.  We understand both Electron and Chromium do not distribute
versions of FFmpeg with GPL content enabled; however, FFmpeg may be configured
enabled to work with proprietary codecs.  It is our understanding these
proprietary codecs may be patented; and as a result, may be subject to
licensing fees.

We strongly recommend downstream consumers verify the type of FFmpeg support
configured and modify as required.  More information on instructions to verify
can be found here
