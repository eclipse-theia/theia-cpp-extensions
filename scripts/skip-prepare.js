/**
 * Theia's `package.json` contains a `prepare` script which is triggered after each install.
 * But we don't always want to build the whole project after installing dependencies.
 * This script looks for an environment variable to skip the prepare step.
 *
 * Example (Unix): `THEIA_SKIP_NPM_PREPARE=1 yarn`
 *
 * Script returns successfully (code=0) when the variable is set, and fails (code>0)
 * when variable is not set. This allows `script || a && b && ...` which will skip
 * the following commands if `script` returns 0, but will keep going otherwise.
